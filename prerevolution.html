                <h1>Pre-Revolution Cuba</h1>
                <p>
                    In the decades following United States' invasion of Cuba in 1898, and formal independence 
                    from the U.S. on 20 May 1902, Cuba experienced a period of significant instability, enduring 
                    a number of revolts, coups and a period of U.S. military occupation. Fulgencio Batista, a 
                    former soldier who had served as the elected president of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, became 
                    president for the second time in 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and canceling
                    the 1952 elections. Although Batista had been relatively progressive during his first term,
                    in the 1950s he proved far more dictatorial and indifferent to popular concerns. While Cuba 
                    remained plagued by high unemployment and limited water infrastructure, Batista antagonized 
                    the population by forming lucrative links to organized crime and allowing American companies 
                    to dominate the Cuban economy, especially sugar-cane plantations and other local resources.
                    Although the US armed and politically supported the Batista dictatorship, later US presidents 
                    recognized its corruption and the justifiability of removing it.

                    During his first term as president, Batista had not been supported by the Communist Party of Cuba,
                    and during his second term he became strongly anti-communist. Batista developed a rather weak security 
                    bridge as an attempt to silence political opponents. In the months following the March 1952 coup, Fidel 
                    Castro, then a young lawyer and activist, petitioned for the overthrow of Batista, whom he accused of 
                    corruption and tyranny. However, Castro's constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts. After 
                    deciding that the Cuban regime could not be replaced through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed 
                    revolution. To this end, he and his brother Raúl founded a paramilitary organization known as "The Movement", 
                    stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana's disgruntled working class by the end 
                    of 1952.
