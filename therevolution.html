                <h1>1953 - 1959: The Revolution</h1>
                <p>
                    Striking their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Raúl Castro gathered Movement 
                    fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on several military installations. On 26 July 1953, 
                    the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo, only to be decisively 
                    defeated by government soldiers. Numerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, 
                    were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his 
                    defense, ending with the words "Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me." Castro's defense 
                    was based on nationalism, the representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, and his 
                    patriotism and justice for the Cuban community. Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the Presidio Modelo 
                    prison, located on Isla de Pinos, while Raúl was sentenced to 13 years. However, in 1955, under broad 
                    political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada 
                    attackers.

                    Soon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in Mexico to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, 
                    receiving training from Alberto Bayo, a leader of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In June 
                    1955, Fidel met the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who joined his cause. Raul and 
                    Castro's chief advisor Ernesto aided the initiation of Batista's amnesty. The revolutionaries named 
                    themselves the "26th of July Movement", in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks 
                    in 1953

                    The yacht Granma departed from Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, on 25 November 1956, carrying the Castro 
                    brothers and 80 others including Ernesto "Che" Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, even though the yacht 
                    was only designed to accommodate 12 people with a maximum of 25. On 2 December, it landed in Playa 
                    Las Coloradas, in the municipality of Niquero, arriving two days later than planned because the boat was 
                    heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs. This dashed any hopes for a coordinated 
                    attack with the llano wing of the Movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began 
                    to make their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek
                    began, Batista's army attacked and killed most of the Granma participants – while the exact number is disputed, 
                    no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped 
                    into the Sierra Maestra mountains. The group of survivors included Fidel and Raúl Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo 
                    Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. 
                    Eventually, the men would link up again – with the help of peasant sympathizers – and would form the core leadership 
                    of the guerrilla army.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Batista finally responded to Castro's efforts with an attack on the mountains called Operation Verano, known to the
                    rebels as la Ofensiva. The army sent some 12,000 soldiers, half of them untrained recruits, into the mountains, along 
                    with his own brother Raul. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro's determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army. 
                    In the Battle of La Plata, which lasted from 11 to 21 July 1958, Castro's forces defeated a 500-man battalion, capturing 
                    240 men while losing just three of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the tide nearly turned on 29 July 1958, when Batista's troops almost destroyed Castro's small 
                    army of some 300 men at the Battle of Las Mercedes. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, 
                    Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while 
                    fruitless negotiations took place, Castro's forces gradually escaped from the trap. By 8 August, Castro's
                    entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure 
                    for the Batista government.
