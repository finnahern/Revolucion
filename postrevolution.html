                <h1>Post Revolution Cuba</h1>
                <p>
                    The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the United 
                    States government was initially willing to recognize Castro's new government, it soon came to 
                    fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had 
                    in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Castro's government resented the Americans for providing aid to 
                    Batista's government during the revolution. After the revolutionary government nationalized 
                    all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban 
                    assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties and tightened its embargo of Cuba. The Key 
                    West–Havana ferry shut down. In 1961, the U.S. government backed an armed counterrevolutionary 
                    assault on the Bay of Pigs with the aim of ousting Castro, but the counterrevolutionaries were 
                    swiftly defeated by the Cuban military. The U.S. Embargo against Cuba – the longest-lasting single 
                    foreign policy in American history – is still in force as of 2020, although it underwent a 
                    partial loosening during the Obama Administration, only to be strengthened in 2017 under Trump. 
                    The U.S. began efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in the mid-2010s, and formally 
                    reopened its embassy in Havana after over half a century in August 2015. The Trump administration 
                    has reversed much of the Cuban Thaw by severely restricting travel by US citizens to Cuba and 
                    tightening the US government's 62-year-old embargo against the country.

                    The US embargo has defined Cuban politics and economics since the revolution. The embargo has been 
                    criticized for its effects on food, clean water, medicine, and other economic needs of the Cuban 
                    population. Criticism has come from both Fidel Castro and Raúl Castro, citizens and groups from within 
                    Cuba, and international organizations and leaders. Some academic critics, outside Cuba, have also 
                    linked the embargo to shortages of medical supplies and soap which have resulted in a series of medical 
                    crises and heightened levels of infectious diseases. Academic critics have also been linked to epidemics 
                    of specific diseases, including neurological disorders and blindness caused by poor nutrition. Travel 
                    restrictions embedded in the embargo have also been shown to limit the amount of medical information that 
                    flows into Cuba from the United States. An article written in 1997 suggests malnutrition and disease 
                    resulting from increased food and medicine prices have affected men and the elderly, in particular, due 
                    to Cuba's rationing system which gives preferential treatment to women and children. Cuban Foreign 
                    Minister Felipe Pérez Roque called the embargo "an act of genocide", quoting a classified State Department 
                    memo dated April 6, 1960 that called on the US to use every tool at its disposal to bring down Fidel 
                    Castro through hunger and disease.
